6. Save each screenshot with the suggested filename in this directory

## Required Screenshots

## Tips for Good Screenshots

2. Ensure the application is sized properly (not too wide/narrow)
3. Make sure text is readable and UI elements are clearly visible
4. For comparison screenshots (like light/dark mode), try to capture the same UI area
5. Use PNG format for best quality
